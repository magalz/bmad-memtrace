# Full Project Scan Instructions

## 🧠 Memtrace Context (Self-Contained)

Memtrace structural graph queries are available as the PRIMARY discovery mechanism for this workflow.
If activation failed to load persistent_facts, this context is sufficient:

**Available MCP tools (used directly in this workflow):**
- `list_indexed_repositories` — check index freshness and repo availability before EVERY query
- `get_directory_tree` (mode=compact/verbose, max_depth=4-6) — project directory structure from File-kind graph nodes
- `list_communities` (min_size=3) — Louvain community clusters as logical module boundaries
- `find_symbol` (kind=Function|Method|Class|Interface, limit=200) — discover exported symbols with kind, file_path, complexity_score
- `find_api_endpoints` (limit=200) — all HTTP endpoints with method, path template, handler function
- `get_api_topology` (include_external=false, min_confidence=0.7) — cross-service HTTP call map
- `get_symbol_context` — callers, callees, type references, community, process per symbol
- `analyze_relationships` (query_type=find_callers|find_callees|imports|exporters) — typed AST dependency edges
- `find_dependency_path` (source, target, max_depth=15, edge_type="calls") — execution path between symbols
- `find_central_symbols` (limit=20) — symbols with highest PageRank (load-bearing code)
- `find_bridge_symbols` (limit=15) — symbols with highest betweenness centrality (architectural chokepoints)
- `get_source_window` — read bounded source for request/response type extraction from handlers

> **Complete Memtrace MCP tool catalog:**
> **Navigation:** find_code, find_symbol, get_source_window, get_directory_tree
> **Architecture:** get_codebase_briefing, list_communities, list_processes, get_process_flow
> **Dependencies:** get_symbol_context, analyze_relationships, get_impact, find_dependency_path, get_api_topology
> **Quality:** find_dead_code, find_most_complex_functions, find_bridge_symbols, find_central_symbols
> **Temporal:** get_evolution, get_changes_since, get_timeline, get_episode_replay
> **Index:** index_directory, list_indexed_repositories, watch_directory, delete_repository

**Rules:**
- All graph queries MUST use sequential `for...of` with `await` — NEVER `Promise.all`
- Check `list_indexed_repositories` before trusting graph output
- Prefer summarized output to stay under 2000 tokens; cap symbol discovery at 200 per batch
- Graph data is PRIMARY source when available; existing heuristic file-reading is preserved as fallback

**Graceful degradation:**
- Memtrace unavailable → set `memtrace_available = false`, skip all graph queries, use existing heuristic file-reading
- Partial query success → apply available data, note partial status in diagnostics
- NEVER block the documentation workflow on Memtrace availability
- Graph data provides STRUCTURAL accuracy; file-reading provides IMPLEMENTATION detail (comments, TODOs, side effects)

<critical>DATA LOADING STRATEGY - Understanding the Documentation Requirements System:</critical>

<action>Display explanation to user:

**How Project Type Detection Works:**

This workflow uses a single comprehensive CSV file to intelligently document your project:

**documentation-requirements.csv** (../documentation-requirements.csv)

- Contains 12 project types (web, mobile, backend, cli, library, desktop, game, data, extension, infra, embedded)
- 24-column schema combining project type detection AND documentation requirements
- **Detection columns**: project_type_id, key_file_patterns (used to identify project type from codebase)
- **Requirement columns**: requires_api_scan, requires_data_models, requires_ui_components, etc.
- **Pattern columns**: critical_directories, test_file_patterns, config_patterns, etc.
- Acts as a "scan guide" - tells the workflow WHERE to look and WHAT to document
- Example: For project_type_id="web", key_file_patterns includes "package.json;tsconfig.json;\*.config.js" and requires_api_scan=true

**When Documentation Requirements are Loaded:**

- **Fresh Start (initial_scan)**: Load all 12 rows → detect type using key_file_patterns → use that row's requirements
- **Resume**: Load ONLY the doc requirements row(s) for cached project_type_id(s)
- **Full Rescan**: Same as fresh start (may re-detect project type)
- **Deep Dive**: Load ONLY doc requirements for the part being deep-dived

  Graph-Based Technology Stack Discovery:

  **A) Directory Structure via Graph:**
  - Use `get_directory_tree` (repo_id={{repo_id}}, mode=compact, max_depth=4) to get the complete project tree
  - The tree is built from Memtrace's File-kind nodes — it automatically respects .gitignore
  - Cross-reference detected directories against `critical_directories` from documentation_requirements
  - This provides structural validation of the project layout BEFORE any file reading

  **B) Logical Module Boundaries:**
  - Use `list_communities` (repo_id={{repo_id}}, min_size=3) to discover Louvain community clusters
  - Communities represent tightly-coupled symbol groups — these are the natural subsystem boundaries
  - Map communities to directory paths using the community symbols' file_path fields
  - Store as `{{memtrace_communities}}` for later use in Steps 5 and 8

  **C) Technology Surface Indicators:**
  - Use `find_symbol` (repo_id={{repo_id}}, kind="Function", limit=30) to sample exported functions
  - Use `find_symbol` (repo_id={{repo_id}}, kind="Class", limit=20) to sample exported classes
  - Analyze symbol patterns for technology indicators:
    - Express/Connect middleware signatures → Node.js API framework
    - React component patterns (capitalized, returns JSX) → Frontend framework
    - Axum handler fn signatures → Rust web framework
    - FastAPI/Flask route decorators → Python web framework
  - Process ALL queries SEQUENTIALLY — NEVER parallelize

  **D) Endpoint Discovery (preview):**
  - Use `find_api_endpoints` (repo_id={{repo_id}}, limit=10) to sample the API surface
  - The endpoint paths and HTTP methods indicate the API framework in use
  - Store endpoint sample for cross-validation in Step 4

    **A) Discover All HTTP Endpoints:**
    - Call `find_api_endpoints` (repo_id={{repo_id}}, limit=200) to get every HTTP endpoint
    - Each result includes: handler function name, HTTP method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/etc.), path template, file_path, line number
    - Group endpoints by: file_path (which file defines them), community (from Step 3 data), path prefix (e.g., /api/users, /api/products)
    - Process STRICTLY SEQUENTIALLY — do NOT parallelize endpoint queries

    **B) Cross-Service Topology:**
    - Call `get_api_topology` (repo_id={{repo_id}}, include_external=false, min_confidence=0.7) for cross-service HTTP calls
    - This reveals which other services call this repo's endpoints AND which services this repo calls
    - Filter to edges where THIS repo is EITHER the source OR target

- For each document that should have been generated, check if file exists on disk
- Set existence flags: architecture_file_exists, component_inventory_exists, dev_guide_exists, etc.
- These flags determine whether to add the _(To be generated)_ marker
- Track which files are missing in {{missing_docs_list}} for reporting

Step 2: For each match found, extract the entire line
Step 3: Parse line to extract:

- Document title (text within [brackets] or **bold**)
- File path (from markdown link or inferable from title)
- Document type (infer from filename: architecture, api-contracts, data-models, component-inventory, development-guide, deployment-guide, integration-architecture)
- Part ID if applicable (extract from filename like "architecture-server.md" → part_id: "server")
  Step 4: Add to {{incomplete_docs_strict}} array

<action>Fallback fuzzy scan for alternate markers:
Search for patterns: _(TBD)_, _(TODO)_, _(Coming soon)_, _(Not yet generated)_, _(Pending)_
